###Crazy Eights Google App Engine Endpoint Game

##Set-Up Instructions:

APIs can be accessed at [https://udacity-scalable-game.appspot.com/_ah/api/explorer](https://udacity-scalable-game.appspot.com/_ah/api/explorer)

##Game Description:

Crazy Eights is a card game.  This implementation is for two players, or one player vs. the computer.  In order to create a game played vs. the computer, enter "Computer" as
the user two name when creating a new game.

Each player is dealt seven cards, and one card is discarded.  Player one has the first turn, and must discard a card that matches either the top discarded card's suit or number.
Eights are "crazy", and can be played at any time to change the suit to the desired suit of the player playing the card.  If the player does not have a match, he must
draw cards until a card can be played.  If the deck runs out, the discarded cards are reshuffled and cards are continued to be drawn until a card can be played.

The first player to discard all his cards wins.

##Web interface:

This implementation is for two players using google+ sign-in, or one player using google+ sign-in versus the computer.  Create a new game on the Games page, access existing games, game histories, and cancel games on the Games
page.  View user scores on the Scores page and update profile information on the Profile page.

Known issue - Google App Engine is extremely slow; 

##Score Keeping
Scores are tracked by storing winning user, losing user, and date.  Users are ranked by winning percentage (games won/total games played.)
